Building a banking platform that stands up to user expectations can be challenging. Simultaniously supporting the ease of use of _personal banking_ while providing advanced _commercial business_ needs is a major task to undertake.

[Q2](https://www.q2ebanking.com/) provides a banking platform that interfaces personal and professional banking needs into a single tool. They then offer this as a customizable _software as a service_ to banks and credit unions big or small. Community banks who would have otherwise had to outsource or hire a team to build a platform with **potential security holes and poor usability are a thing of the past**.

These solutions need to scale. A company like Q2 exposes you to tremendously skilled people who's talent rubs off on you as you learn to ship features and maintain the stability of an ever evolving application many depend on. I helped lead the drive towards integration and acceptance testing along with a **test driven development initiative to change the culture of development** for the better.
