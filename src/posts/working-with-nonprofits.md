There's more than one way to volunteer in today's world. Offering one's skills as a web designer and developer is a great way to give back while tackling unique challenges.

## The SEED

### Adult & Family Learning Community

Through analytics it was apparent very few could find out how to sign up for classes on learning English - an all English website and the page being burried through subnavs was the likely culprit. We user tested some updated designs where a non-native speaker could jump right to a Spanish page on how to sign up for classes first.

We then **improved Spanish support** for the rest of the website to support all the user personas we had discovered: _The Student, The Donor, and The Volunteer_. Next up was improving ways people can get involved either through their time or their dollar through a better workflow and cleaned up content.

Small tweaks made a world of difference for these users. Even ensuring the site ran on **HTTPS significantly raised the confidence of a potential donor**. I just about cried _tears of happiness when the thank you letters came in_ from the group for impact we made on their group and org.
