Patient education is hard. Plastic eyeballs as a teaching tool is a thing of the past. Modern media and technology can help solve this problem.

Formerly known as **Eyemaginations**, the company **Rendia** offers high quality animations to _doctors_ to communicate complex medical topics to their _patients and their families_.

Doctors can build playlists of content, upload their own images/videos, and then share their creations with patients via email and by embedding them directly on their practice website. Or they can play this content right in their practice while taking advantage of onscreen drawing features with a mouse or touch device. The media player offers content protection, and patients may choose between multiple languages, closed captions, fullscreen, and more.
