    "text": "## The SEED \n ### Adult & Family Learning Community \n Through analytics it was apparent very few could find out how to sign up for classes on learning English - an all English website and the page being burried through subnavs was the likely culprit. We user tested some updated designs where a non-native speaker could jump right to a Spanish page on how to sign up for classes first. \n\n ![The Seed Volunteers](./assets/theseed1.jpg) \n\n We then improved **internationalization** for the rest of the website to support all the user personas we had discovered: _The Student, The Donor, and The Volunteer_. Next up was improving ways people can get involved either through their time or their dollar through a better workflow and cleaned up content. \n\n ![The Seed Wireframes](./assets/theseed2.png) \n\n Small tweaks made a world of difference for these users. Even ensuring the site ran on **HTTPS significantly raised the confidence of a potential donor**. I just about cried tears of happiness when the thank you letters came in from the group for impact we made on their group and org. \n\n ![Thank you letters](./assets/theseed3.png)"
